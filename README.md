## Course Policies

### Deadlines

As media students, you will be expected to meet deadlines. Work must be submitted at the beginning of the class period in which it is due.

**Late work will not be accepted** except under the most extreme circumstances. This counts for both exams and assingments. As your instructor, I will determine what constitutes an extreme circumstance. Computer issues of any kind are not an excuse for delaying submission.

**Any assignment not submitted will count as a zero** (0) toward your final grade. Missed assignments will result in a significantly lower final grade and may lead to failure of the course. I&#39;ve worked as a photojournalist and a corporate web designer; know that I take this very seriously.

As stated above, computer issues of any kind are not an excuse. Backup your work! Don&#39;t rely on external hard drives as they fail easily. Use a flash drive. Better yet, use a cloud-solution like DropBox. If you don&#39;t have a DropBox account, you can use this link for extra free space: bit.ly/WUdropbox

### Attendance

You are expected to attend every class. Your presence and active discussion at all course meetings is at the heart of a meaningful class experience. **More than**  **two**  **unexcused absences will result in an automatic grade reduction.**

| 3 absences | 33 point deduction |
| --- | --- |
| 4 absences | 100 point deduction |
| 5+ absences | 200 point deduction |

Absences for official university sanctioned events will count as a half (0.5) absence. This includes sports, professional events, choir and other similar absences.

If you cannot attend a class, you are responsible for finding out what material was covered that day and how to get caught up.

Students who are late or leave class early will be marked for a half absence. Students who are overly late or leave excessively early (as determined by the instructor) will be marked for a full absence for that session.

### Bonus

You may earn bonus points for submitting newspaper, magazine, or journal articles relevant to our class discussions. Each article submitted is worth one bonus point, and you may submit as many as 10 articles. However, no more than one article may be submitted during any given class period. These bonus points will be added to the final exam. If the article is acceptable, you will be asked to present it to the class.

### Inclement Weather

If we miss a class due to the weather, do not assume we will cover the material scheduled for that day at the next meeting. Continue to read ahead and be prepared for the next assignment. Any assignment or test due on a missed day will occur at the next class period **.** If the missed day is prior to the test/paper, the test/paper will go on as scheduled.

### Technology Etiquette

Phones and other communication technologies (can be very disruptive to the academic process. All media (phones, headphones, etc.) are to be turned off and placed out of sight while class is in session. Students caught checking their phones, texting, surfing the Internet, or using other media during class will be counted as absent. Students caught on their phones or using other media during an exam or any graded exercise will be cited for academic dishonesty and will be asked to immediately leave the class.

### Course evaluations

You are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing an online course evaluation at the end of the semester. Evaluations are open during the final two weeks of the semester and you will be alerted via e-mail when they are available.

## University Policies

### Social justice

If you are a student with a learning and/or physical disability, and you require specific accommodations, or if you discover you have such a need during the semester, please contact Brian Carr, Director of the Center for Student Success (724-852-3317), within the first week of class or within a week of knowing you need accommodation, so that arrangements can be made to accommodate your special needs.

### Academic Integrity

The principles of truth and honesty are recognized as fundamental to any community of teachers and scholars. The University has a responsibility for maintaining academic integrity to protect the quality of education, research, and co-curricular activities on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity.

In this course, I exercise great care when planning your assignments, so that honest effort will be positively encouraged. It is your responsibility of to refrain from academic dishonesty and from conduct which aids others in academic dishonesty. **This responsibility means that all academic work will be done by you without unauthorized aid**  **of any kind****.**

If any instance of academic dishonesty is discovered, I will notify you in writing so that we can discuss the proposed sanction. If you are found guilty of cheating or plagiarism, you will receive an &quot;F&quot; for the exam or assignment. A repeat incident of academic dishonesty in any form will result in failure of the course.

Please read the material in your Waynesburg University Academic Catalog that states the entire Waynesburg University Academic Integrity Policy (pg. 60 2016-2017 Waynesburg University Academic Catalog).

### Code of Conduct
